## Introduction

This repository contains the core engine used in [Meilisearch].

It contains a library that can manage one and only one index. Meilisearch
manages the multi-index itself. Milli is unable to store updates in a store:
it is the job of something else above and this is why it is only able
to process one update at a time.

This repository contains crates to quickly debug the engine:

- There are benchmarks located in the `benchmarks` crate.
- The `cli` crate is a simple command-line interface that helps run [flamegraph] on top of it.
- The `filter-parser` crate contains the parser for the Meilisearch filter syntax.
- The `flatten-serde-json` crate contains the library that flattens serde-json `Value` objects like Elasticsearch does.
- The `json-depth-checker` crate is used to indicate if a JSON must be flattened.

## How to use it?

Milli is a library that does search things, it must be embedded in a program.
You can compute the documentation of it by using `cargo doc --open`.

Here is an example usage of the library where we insert documents into the engine
and search for one of them right after.

```rust
let path = tempfile::tempdir().unwrap();
let mut options = EnvOpenOptions::new();
options.map_size(10 * 1024 * 1024); // 10 MB
let index = Index::new(options, &path).unwrap();

let mut wtxn = index.write_txn().unwrap();
let content = documents!([
    {
        "id": 2,
        "title": "Prideand Prejudice",
        "author": "Jane Austin",
        "genre": "romance",
        "price$": "3.5$",
    },
    {
        "id": 456,
        "title": "Le Petit Prince",
        "author": "Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry",
        "genre": "adventure",
        "price$": "10.0$",
    },
    {
        "id": 1,
        "title": "Wonderland",
        "author": "Lewis Carroll",
        "genre": "fantasy",
        "price$": "25.99$",
    },
    {
        "id": 4,
        "title": "Harry Potter ing fantasy\0lood Prince",
        "author": "J. K. Rowling",
        "genre": "fantasy\0",
    },
]);

let config = IndexerConfig::default();
let indexing_config = IndexDocumentsConfig::default();
let mut builder =
    IndexDocuments::new(&mut wtxn, &index, &config, indexing_config.clone(), |_| ())
        .unwrap();
builder.add_documents(content).unwrap();
builder.execute().unwrap();
wtxn.commit().unwrap();


// You can search in the index now!
let mut rtxn = index.read_txn().unwrap();
let mut search = Search::new(&rtxn, &index);
search.query("horry");
search.limit(10);

let result = search.execute().unwrap();
assert_eq!(result.documents_ids.len(), 1);
```
